2,Ask ChatGPT: MariaDB Performance Tuning: Tips and Tricks
2,Written by Written by Ian Gilfillan 2023-04-212023-04-21
2,"This is the next in the series of posts exploring ChatGPT and its insights about MariaDB. The series began with ChatGPT, OpenAI and MariaDB Foundation, followed by Ask ChatGPT – Getting Started with MariaDB: A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners."
2,"This week’s topic, suggested by ChatGPT itself, was “MariaDB Performance Tuning”. So how did it do?"
2,"MariaDB is undoubtedly one of the most popular open-source database management systems available today, with a strong focus on performance and ease of use. Whether you are a developer, database administrator, or an IT professional, ensuring that your MariaDB installation performs efficiently is crucial. In this blog, we will discuss some key tips and tricks for tuning your MariaDB server, improving its performance in various environments."
2,Identifying Bottlenecks
2,"Before diving into any optimization techniques, it’s crucial to identify the areas where performance might need improvement. Some common tools that will help you to pinpoint performance bottlenecks are:"
2,"MariaDB’s slow query log: This log records queries that take longer-than-expected to execute, helping you identify problematic SQL code."
2,"Performance Schema: A feature in MariaDB that allows you to monitor various metrics, such as query performance and resource usage."
2,mtop and mytop: These are real-time monitoring tools that show the MySQL server’s status and queries being executed at any given time.
2,"I thought we were talking about MariaDB here? And as far as I know, mtop was last updated in 2004, so I’m not sure this would be very useful. A pet bugbear about ChatGPT is its reluctance to provide links. It sometimes behaves a bit like an ignorant loudmouth, confidently spouting forth on something or other, but when you challenge them to provide evidence, nothing is forthcoming. At least it doesn’t launch into ad hominems. Its advice to use the slow query log and the performance schema can be helpful, but links would be useful. So, here are links to find out more about the slow query log, Performance Schema, as well as mtop and mytop."
2,Using these tools will give you an idea of the specific areas in which your MariaDB server needs tuning.
2,General Performance Tips
2,Optimize SQL queries
2,"Poorly written queries can lead to significant performance hits, and as such, properly optimizing SQL code is a critical step in improving the performance of your MariaDB server."
2,"Use EXPLAIN: The EXPLAIN command helps you understand how the MariaDB optimizer executes a query, allowing you to identify potentially slow operations and improve the query strategy."
2,"Proper indexing: Design and use indexes effectively to optimize search performance. Keep in mind that while more indexes can speed up SELECT queries, they may also slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations."
2,"Avoid using SELECT *: Instead of using SELECT * (which retrieves all columns), specify only the required columns in your queries."
2,"True, but a rather lacking in specifics, and again, links to actually find out anything useful. Try EXPLAIN and Optimizing and Indexes. To save repetition, I’ll add links directly into GPT’s text for the rest of this post."
2,Update MariaDB to the latest version
2,"MariaDB receives regular updates and improvements, so keeping your installation up-to-date is an essential step in getting the best performance possible. New releases might include feature enhancements, bug fixes, and security patches, all of which contribute to better overall performance."
2,Server-specific Performance Tips
2,Configuring InnoDB Variables
2,"InnoDB is the default storage engine for MariaDB, and adjusting its settings can significantly improve the performance of your server. Some critical InnoDB settings to consider are:"
2,"innodb_buffer_pool_size: Allocate more memory to the InnoDB buffer pool to reduce disk I/O. Typically, this value should be set to at least 70-80% of the available memory."
2,"innodb_log_file_size: A larger log file size reduces the need for frequent log rotations, thus improving write performance. However, a log size that is too large might slow down the recovery process after a crash."
2,Tweak Query Cache Variables
2,"MariaDB’s query cache is a feature that stores the results of executed queries in memory, allowing the server to serve identical queries without re-executing them."
2,"query_cache_size: Increase the size of the query cache if you have spare memory, which can improve performance for repeat queries."
2,"query_cache_limit: This value sets the maximum size of an individual query’s result that can be cached. A larger limit might cache more queries, but it might also cause more fragmentation."
2,"This isn’t very good advice. There’s a reason the query cache is disabled by default, as in many environments it actually slows things down. It may help in certain contexts, but you’d want to test this, and not blindly enable it."
2,Hardware Optimizations
2,"When it comes to improving database performance, hardware optimization is often overlooked. Some quick hardware-related adjustments you can make include:"
2,Use fast SSDs for your storage: SSDs can significantly improve read/write performance and offer better reliability than traditional hard disk drives.
2,"Increase available memory: More RAM will allow you to allocate larger InnoDB buffer pools and query caches, reducing I/O operations and improving performance."
2,"In conclusion, performance tuning for MariaDB is a continuous process. Regularly monitoring and optimizing your queries, staying up-to-date with new releases, and fine-tuning server settings as needed will contribute to the overall performance of your MariaDB installation. By following the tips and tricks outlined in this article, you are well on your way to maintaining a high-performance MariaDB server."
2,"Overall, very light on details, but a reasonably helpful high-level overview with just enough wrong to lead someone following it down some dead ends. My guess is that it overly prioritises some well-respected, but now dated, sources. It would help to train GPT to prioritise the official MariaDB Server documentation."

8,MariaDB starting with 10.6.13
8,hash_join_cardinality optimizer_switch Flag
8,MariaDB starting with 10.6.13The hash_join_cardinality optimizer_switch flag was added in
8,"MariaDB 11.0.2, MariaDB 10.11.3,"
8,"MariaDB 10.10.4, MariaDB 10.9.6, MariaDB 10.8.8 and MariaDB 10.6.13."
8,"In MySQL and MariaDB, the output cardinality of a part of query has historically been tied to the used access method(s). This is different from the approach used in database textbooks. There, the cardinality ""x JOIN y"" is the same regardless of which access methods are used to compute it."
8,Example
8,Consider a query joining customers with their orders:
8,select *
8,from
8,"customer, orders, ..."
8,where
8,customer.id = orders.customer_id and ...
8,"Suppose, table orders has an index IDX on orders.customer_id."
8,"If the query plan is using this index to fetch orders for each customer, the optimizer will use index statistics from IDX to estimate the number of rows in the customer-joined-with-orders."
8,"On the other hand, if the optimizer considers a query plan that"
8,"joins customer with orders without use of indexes, it will ignore the customer.id = orders.customer_id equality completely and will compute the"
8,output cardinality as if customer was cross-joined with orders.
8,Hash Join
8,"MariaDB supports Block Hash Join. It is not enabled by default, one needs to set it join_cache_level to 3 or a bigger value to enable it."
8,"Before MDEV-30812, Query optimization for Block Hash Join would work as described in the above example: It would assume that the join operation is a cross join."
8,"MDEV-30812 introduces a new optimizer_switch flag, hash_join_cardinality. In MariaDB versions before 11.0, it is off by default."
8,"If one sets it to ON, the optimizer will make use of column histograms when computing the cardinality of hash join operation output."
8,"One can see the computation in the Optimizer Trace,"
8,search for hash_join_cardinality.

10,MariaDB starting with 11.3
10,Connection Redirection Mechanism in the MariaDB Client/Server Protocol
10,MariaDB starting with 11.3A connection redirection mechanism was added in MariaDB 11.3.0 (MDEV-15935)
10,Redirection mechanisms are widely used in proxy-based scenarios.
10,"Previously, when multiple servers shared one proxy, the proxy forwarded all packets between servers and clients. Thus, the proxy added latency, consuming computing resources and impacting overall performance. For scenarios with many short connections, such as WordPress, latency can be a critical issue."
10,"With a redirection mechanism, much like HTTP redirects or Oracle redirected connections, clients get the servers’ address from proxies and connect to servers transparently, without latency and without wasting resources."
10,Usage
10,"Redirection is handled through a new system variable, redirect_url. The value defaults to an empty string, but can also contain a connection string in the conventional format (in the style of a Connector/C etc. connection url)."
10,"This variable is appended to the default value of the session_track_system_variables system variable. If not empty, clients will be redirected to the specified server."
10,Possible Use Cases
10,Always redirect all clients to a new location:
10,"set @@global.redirect_url, start the server with --redurect-url=, or put it in my.cnf"
10,redirect to a group of servers randomly
10,"create a table with connection urls, one per row."
10,use an sql script that selects a random row from it and sets @@redirect_url to this value
10,specify this script in the --init-connect server parameter
10,dynamically redirect from the primary to one of the replicas
10,"same as above, but use INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST to get the list of active replicas."
10,Example
10,"set global redirect_url=""mysql://mariadb.org:12345"";"
10,Invalid formats are not permitted:
10,"set global redirect_url=""mysql://mariadb.org:"";"
10,ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'redirect_url' can't be set to the value of 'mysql://mariadb.org:'
