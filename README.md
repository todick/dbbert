# DB-BERT: the Tuning Tool that "Reads" the Manual

This is a fork of DB-BERT, an LLM-based tool to tune database management systems based on hints
given in natural language. 

This fork is used for research purposes, so the provided functionality may differ from the
original DB-BERT and the GUI is no longer supported. For information on how to run DB-BERT via
the command line, refer to the documentation of the original repository:
